# Background

Starting in 4th grade, I have been fascinated by the art of coding and being able to create whatever you want with just a few lines of code. However, I couldn't get a traditional education in Computer Science through my elementary or middle school, so I taught myself on my own. This continued until my junior year in high school, when I attended my first computer science class, AP Computer Science. I could use my intuitive coding skills that I had learned outside of school to pass with flying colors and score a 5 on the exam. Ever since that course, I have been expanding my knowledge in Computer Science in whatever way I can to further my interest in the field. I'm currently attending the University of Toronto, focusing in the field of Computer Science.
