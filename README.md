# Background

Starting in 4th grade I have been fascinated in the art of coding and being able to create whatever you want with just a few lines of code. However, I wasn't able to get a traditional education in Computer Science through my elementary or middle school, so I taught myself on my own. This would continue until my junior year in high school where I attended my first Computer Science class titled AP Computer Science. I was able to use my intuitive coding skills that I had learned on my own outside of school to pass with flying colors, and score a 5 on the exam. Ever since that course, I have been expanding my knowledge in Computer Science whatever way that I can to further my interest in the field. I'm currently attending the University of Toronto focusing in the field of Computer Science.
